                Vaccines save millions of lives each year. Vaccines work by training and preparing the body’s natural
                defences – the immune system – to recognize and fight off the viruses and bacteria they target. After
                vaccination, if the body is later exposed to those disease-causing germs, the body is immediately ready
                to destroy them, preventing illness.</p>

            <p>
                <span class="bold">Take whatever vaccine is made available to you first, even if you have already had
                    COVID-19. It is important to be vaccinated as soon as possible once it’s your turn and not
                    wait.</span>
                Approved COVID-19
                vaccines provide a high degree of protection against getting seriously ill and dying from the disease,
                although no vaccine is 100% protective.
